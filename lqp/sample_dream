There was a mice that crawled in my beg, I grabbed it and started squeezing it and it started to shit up the place some hard stool then I squeezed it harder and the shit became watery. I wrapped it in plastic to prevent it from messing up everywhere then brought it outside and squeezed it even harder thinking it was dead I released my grip and put it down only to find it was playing dead and ran away I came back inside to clean up the mess but couldn't find any.
